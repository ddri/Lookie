# Configuration Management for Cloud-Native Go Applications

Cloud-native applications require sophisticated configuration management that supports multiple deployment environments, secure secret handling, and dynamic reconfiguration capabilities. Effective configuration strategies must balance security, operational simplicity, and development velocity while maintaining clear separation between application code and environmental concerns. Lookie's implementation demonstrates practical approaches to these challenges using modern Go patterns and cloud-native tools.

## Environment-Specific Configuration Without Secrets Exposure

Production configuration management requires clear separation between non-sensitive configuration data and secrets while maintaining operational simplicity across multiple deployment environments. Effective strategies enable environment-specific customization without creating security vulnerabilities or operational complexity.

Configuration layering provides hierarchical value resolution that accommodates default values, environment-specific overrides, and local development customization. Lookie implements a layered approach using embedded defaults, configuration files, environment variables, and command-line flags with appropriate precedence ordering.
